# React Native FlatList Missing Key Prop

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native FlatLists: the missing `key` prop.  A missing `key` prop can lead to performance problems and incorrect rendering, particularly when the data changes.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version with the `key` prop added to each item.

This is a crucial aspect of optimizing FlatList performance and ensuring data integrity.
